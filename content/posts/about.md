Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Nelson, and I'm passionate about learning coding and security. Iâ€™m a developer with a background in web development, and I love exploring new technologies and improving my skills.

## My Journey

I started my journey in software development when I was in college. Since then, I've been dedicated to honing my skills and expanding my knowledge in areas like:

- **PHP, Laravel, Vue.js, and React** â€“ My core web development stack.
- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) and NGINX** â€“ For server administration and hosting.
- **AWS, DigitalOcean, and Contabo** â€“ Cloud services I use for deploying and managing applications.

## What I Love Working On

I enjoy creating projects that involve web applications, secure systems, or responsive user interfaces. My favorite part of development is solving challenging problems, learning new frameworks, and collaborating with others.

In addition to my technical skills, Iâ€™m also passionate about learning more about cybersecurity and helping others learn to code. This helps me approach my work with creativity and a focus on both functionality and user experience.

## Fun Facts

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning on react native and exploring more about it.

- ðŸ“š Outside of work, I love hiking, gaming, and anime.
