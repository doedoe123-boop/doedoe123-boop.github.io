Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I wanted to take some time to share my journey in software development. It's been an incredible experience filled with learning, challenges, and growth, and Iâ€™m excited to tell you more about it.

## Getting Started

I first got interested in coding when I took my first programming class in college and I started building websites as a hobby". I remember feeling excited but intimidated and decided to dive deeper into this world.

## Learning and Growing

Since then, Iâ€™ve dedicated a lot of time to learning and improving my skills. Along the way, Iâ€™ve explored areas like:
- **HTML** â€“ When I first started, I wrote HTML in Notepad, creating basic pages with plain HTML. It was a great way to understand the fundamentals of web structure.
- **CSS** â€“ As I grew more confident with HTML, I started learning CSS to style my pages and make them visually appealing. This opened a whole new world of design possibilities.
- **JavaScript** â€“ JavaScript came next, allowing me to add interactivity and dynamic elements to my projects. This has been particularly useful in making my pages engaging and functional.

Each of these technologies formed the foundation of my web development skills and set me on a path to creating more complex, dynamic websites.

## Challenges and Milestones

It hasnâ€™t always been easy! Some of my biggest challenges include:
- **Learning CSS Layouts** â€“ Understanding layouts and positioning was tricky at first, but itâ€™s a skill that has greatly improved my design approach.
- **JavaScript Logic** â€“ Initially, building interactive features with JavaScript was challenging, but as I practiced, I became more comfortable with logic and functions.

Despite these challenges, Iâ€™m grateful for the milestones Iâ€™ve reached, and I continue to learn and grow with each project.

## Looking Forward

Iâ€™m excited about what lies ahead! My goals for the future include:
- **Learning advanced frameworks** â€“ such as React or Vue, to expand my skills.
- **Building full-stack projects** â€“ to gain a deeper understanding of web development.

Thank you for reading my journey! I hope to continue learning, building, and sharing my experiences with others.
